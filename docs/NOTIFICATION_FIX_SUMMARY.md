# Notification Screen Fix Summary

## 🐛 **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Teacher Seeing Student Notifications**
**Problem**: Teachers were seeing student notifications instead of their own notifications.

**Root Cause**: The NotificationScreen was using `currentStudentAuthCode` from NotificationContext without properly checking the user type, causing it to always show student notifications when in parent context.

**Solution**: 
- Added user type detection in NotificationScreen
- Modified logic to show appropriate notifications based on user type:
  - **Teachers**: Show their own notifications
  - **Students**: Show their own notifications  
  - **Parents**: Show selected student's notifications

### 2. **Notifications Not Marked as Read When Tapped**
**Problem**: Tapping on notifications didn't mark them as read.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `renderNotificationItem` to call `markAsRead()` when notification is tapped
- Added proper navigation handling based on notification type
- Added fallback to show notification details in alert

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### NotificationScreen.js
```javascript
// Added user type detection
const [userType, setUserType] = useState(null);

// Get user type from route params or AsyncStorage
useEffect(() => {
  const getUserType = async () => {
    if (route?.params?.userType) {
      setUserType(route.params.userType);
      return;
    }
    
    const userData = await AsyncStorage.getItem('userData');
    if (userData) {
      const user = JSON.parse(userData);
      setUserType(user.userType || 'teacher');
    }
  };
  getUserType();
}, [route?.params?.userType]);

// Fixed notification context logic
const getActiveNotifications = () => {
  if (userType === 'parent' && currentStudentAuthCode) {
    return getCurrentStudentNotifications();
  }
  return notifications; // For teachers and students
};

// Fixed mark as read functionality
const renderNotificationItem = ({ item }) => (
  <NotificationItem
    notification={item}
    onPress={async (notification) => {
      // Mark as read when tapped
      if (!notification.read) {
        await markAsRead(notification.id);
      }
      
      // Handle navigation based on type
      switch (notification.type) {
        case 'attendance':
        case 'grade':
        case 'announcement':
        case 'timetable':
          // Navigate to relevant screens
          break;
        default:
          Alert.alert(notification.title, notification.body);
          break;
      }
    }}
  />
);
```

### Navigation Updates
Updated all screens that navigate to NotificationScreen to pass correct userType:

**TeacherScreen.js**:
```javascript
navigation.navigate('NotificationScreen', { userType: 'teacher' })
```

**ParentScreen.js**:
```javascript
navigation.navigate('NotificationScreen', { userType: 'parent' })
```

**Student Screens** (TimetableScreen, GradesScreen, AttendanceScreen, LibraryScreen):
```javascript
navigation.navigate('NotificationScreen', { userType: 'student' })
```

## ✅ **Expected Behavior Now**

### For Teachers:
- ✅ See only teacher-specific notifications
- ✅ Notifications marked as read when tapped
- ✅ Proper API calls for teacher notifications

### For Students:
- ✅ See only their own notifications
- ✅ Notifications marked as read when tapped
- ✅ Proper API calls for student notifications

### For Parents:
- ✅ See selected student's notifications
- ✅ Notifications marked as read when tapped
- ✅ Proper API calls for student notifications

## 🧪 **Testing**

To test the fixes:

1. **Teacher Test**:
   - Login as teacher
   - Navigate to NotificationScreen from TeacherScreen
   - Verify only teacher notifications are shown
   - Tap notifications to verify they're marked as read

2. **Student Test**:
   - Login as student
   - Navigate to NotificationScreen from any student screen
   - Verify only student notifications are shown
   - Tap notifications to verify they're marked as read

3. **Parent Test**:
   - Login as parent
   - Select a student
   - Navigate to NotificationScreen
   - Verify selected student's notifications are shown
   - Tap notifications to verify they're marked as read

## 🔄 **API Calls**

The notification screen now makes appropriate API calls based on user type:

- **Teachers/Students**: Uses `markAllAPINotificationsAsRead()`
- **Parents**: Uses `markAllStudentNotificationsAsRead(studentAuthCode)`

## 📱 **User Experience Improvements**

1. **Clear Context**: Users now see notifications relevant to their role
2. **Interactive Notifications**: Tapping notifications marks them as read
3. **Smart Navigation**: Notifications can navigate to relevant screens
4. **Fallback Display**: Unknown notification types show details in alert
5. **Proper State Management**: Notification counts update correctly after marking as read

## 🚀 **Ready for Testing**

The notification system is now properly segmented by user type and provides the expected functionality for marking notifications as read when tapped.
