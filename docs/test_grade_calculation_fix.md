# Grade Calculation Fix Test

## Problem Description

Student has grades: 90%(10% weight), 50%(10% weight), 100%(40% weight), 100%(40% weight) from Mathematics
But subject card shows average of 33% and Letter Grade F.

**Root Cause Identified**: The API is returning **raw scores instead of percentages**!

From console logs:

- Assignment on ch-3: Raw score 90/100 = 90%, but API returns **9%** ❌
- Assignment on ch-2: Raw score 50/100 = 50%, but API returns **5%** ❌
- Quiz on ch-2: Raw score 100/100 = 100%, but API returns **40%** ❌
- Quiz on ch-1: Raw score 100/100 = 100%, but API returns **40%** ❌

**Actual Calculation**: (9×10 + 5×10 + 40×40 + 40×40) ÷ 100 = 33% ❌
**Should Be**: (90×10 + 50×10 + 100×40 + 100×40) ÷ 100 = 94% ✅

## Correct Calculation Logic

When weight system is **incomplete** (total weights ≠ 100%), use **simple average**:

- 10% assessments: (90% + 50%) ÷ 2 = 70%
- 40% assessments: (100% + 100%) ÷ 2 = 100%
- **Simple average**: (90% + 50% + 100% + 100%) ÷ 4 = **85%** ✅

When weight system is **complete** (total weights ≈ 100%), use **weighted average**:

- Only when all assessment types are present and total weights = 100%

## Root Cause

The `getSubjectAverage` function was calculating a simple average instead of considering the weight system (type_percentage or max_score weights).

## Solution Implemented

### Enhanced Grade Calculation Logic:

1. **Weighted Calculation (when all weights available)**:

   - Uses `type_percentage` field from each assessment
   - Formula: `(sum of grade * weight) / total weight * 100`
   - Example: If we have grades with weights:
     - 90% with 10% weight → contributes 9 points
     - 50% with 10% weight → contributes 5 points
     - 100% with 40% weight → contributes 40 points
     - 100% with 40% weight → contributes 40 points
     - Total: (9 + 5 + 40 + 40) / (10 + 10 + 40 + 40) \* 100 = 94%

2. **Simple Average (fallback)**:
   - Used when not all assessments have weight information
   - Formula: `sum of grades / number of grades`
   - Example: (90 + 50 + 100 + 100) / 4 = 85%

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Enhanced Data Structure**: Each grade now includes:

   ```javascript
   {
     grade: gradeValue,           // The percentage score
     weight: grade.type_percentage, // Weight of this assessment type
     maxScore: grade.max_score,   // Maximum possible score
     rawScore: grade.raw_score    // Raw score achieved
   }
   ```

2. **Smart Weight Detection**:

   - Checks if ALL grades in a subject have weight information
   - Only uses weighted calculation when complete weight data is available
   - Falls back to simple average otherwise

3. **Detailed Logging**:
   - Console logs show which calculation method is being used
   - Displays grade data and weights for debugging
   - Shows final calculated average

### Expected Results:

**Before Fix:**

- Mathematics: 24% (F) - Incorrect calculation

**After Fix (Incomplete Weight System):**

- Mathematics: 85% (A) - Correct simple average
- Label shows "Average (Incomplete)" indicating weight system is not complete

**After Fix (Complete Weight System):**

- Mathematics: 94% (A\*) - Correct weighted average when all assessment types present
- Label shows "Average (Weighted)" indicating full weighted calculation

### Test Cases:

1. **All Weights Available**: Should use weighted calculation
2. **Missing Weights**: Should use simple average
3. **Zero Total Weight**: Should fallback to simple average
4. **Mixed Weight Data**: Should use simple average

### Verification Steps:

1. Check console logs for calculation method used
2. Verify subject card shows correct percentage
3. Verify letter grade matches percentage
4. Test with different weight combinations
5. Ensure fallback works when weights are missing

## Files Modified:

- `src/screens/GradesScreen.js` - Enhanced `getSubjectAverage` function

## Impact:

- ✅ Accurate grade calculations using weight system
- ✅ Proper fallback to simple average when needed
- ✅ Better debugging with detailed console logs
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility
