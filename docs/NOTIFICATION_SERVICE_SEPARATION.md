# Notification Service Separation - Fix for Cross-User Contamination

## Problem Summary

The notification system had a critical issue where notifications from different user types (teacher, student, parent) were getting mixed up:

1. **Student seeing teacher's notifications**: When both teacher and student were logged in, students would see teacher notification counts
2. **Mark all as read affecting wrong user**: Marking all notifications as read for a student would mark teacher's notifications as read
3. **Parent errors**: Parents couldn't mark all notifications as read, getting errors

### Root Cause

The original `notificationService.js` used a **priority-based authCode selection** that always preferred:
```
parent â†’ teacher â†’ student
```

This meant that when multiple user types were logged in, the service would always use the highest priority user's authCode, causing cross-contamination.

## Solution

We separated the notification services by user type, creating three dedicated services:

1. **`teacherNotificationService.js`** - Only uses teacher authCode
2. **`parentNotificationService.js`** - Only uses parent authCode  
3. **`studentNotificationService.js`** - Only uses student authCode

Each service:
- Has its own `getAuthCode()` function that ONLY retrieves its specific user type's authCode
- Provides user-type-specific functions (getNotifications, markAsRead, markAllAsRead, etc.)
- Prevents cross-contamination by design

## Changes Made

### 1. New Service Files

#### `src/services/teacherNotificationService.js`
- `getTeacherNotifications()` - Fetch teacher notifications
- `markTeacherNotificationAsRead()` - Mark single notification as read
- `markAllTeacherNotificationsAsRead()` - Mark all teacher notifications as read
- `getTeacherNotificationCategories()` - Get notification categories
- `sendTeacherNotification()` - Send notifications (teacher only)
- `getTeacherNotificationStatistics()` - Get statistics (teacher only)

#### `src/services/parentNotificationService.js`
- `getParentNotifications()` - Fetch parent notifications
- `markParentNotificationAsRead()` - Mark single notification as read
- `markAllParentNotificationsAsRead()` - Mark all parent notifications as read
- `getParentNotificationCategories()` - Get notification categories

#### `src/services/studentNotificationService.js`
- `getStudentNotifications()` - Fetch student notifications
- `markStudentNotificationAsRead()` - Mark single notification as read
- `markAllStudentNotificationsAsRead()` - Mark all student notifications as read
- `getStudentNotificationCategories()` - Get notification categories

### 2. Updated NotificationContext

**`src/contexts/NotificationContext.js`**

Added:
- `detectUserType()` - Detects current user type from AsyncStorage
- `getNotificationService(userType)` - Returns appropriate service based on user type
- Updated all notification functions to use user-type-specific services

Key changes:
- `loadNotifications()` - Now detects user type and uses appropriate service
- `markAPINotificationAsRead()` - Uses user-type-specific mark as read
- `markAllAPINotificationsAsRead()` - Uses user-type-specific mark all as read
- `fetchNotificationCategories()` - Uses user-type-specific categories
- `sendNotificationToAPI()` - Only allows teachers to send notifications
- `fetchNotificationStatistics()` - Only allows teachers to view statistics

### 3. Updated NotificationScreen

**`src/screens/NotificationScreen.js`**

Changed `loadNotificationsForUserType()` to:
- Use user-type-specific services instead of direct API calls
- Automatically route to correct service based on userType parameter
- Simplified code by removing manual authCode handling

### 4. Badge Components

**`src/components/NotificationBadge.js`** and **`src/components/ParentNotificationBadge.js`**

No changes needed - they already use NotificationContext which now provides correct user-type-specific counts.

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Student Notifications Isolation

1. **Setup**: Log in as both a teacher and a student
2. **Test**:
   - Navigate to student dashboard
   - Check notification badge count
   - Open notifications screen
3. **Expected**: Student should see ONLY student notifications, not teacher notifications
4. **Verify**: Badge count matches actual student notifications

### Test 2: Teacher Notifications Isolation

1. **Setup**: Same as Test 1 (both teacher and student logged in)
2. **Test**:
   - Navigate to teacher dashboard
   - Check notification badge count
   - Open notifications screen
3. **Expected**: Teacher should see ONLY teacher notifications, not student notifications
4. **Verify**: Badge count matches actual teacher notifications

### Test 3: Mark All As Read - Student

1. **Setup**: Log in as both teacher and student, ensure both have unread notifications
2. **Test**:
   - Navigate to student notifications
   - Tap "Mark All As Read"
   - Check student notification badge (should be 0)
   - Navigate to teacher notifications
   - Check teacher notification badge
3. **Expected**: 
   - Student notifications marked as read
   - Teacher notifications remain unread
   - No errors

### Test 4: Mark All As Read - Teacher

1. **Setup**: Same as Test 3
2. **Test**:
   - Navigate to teacher notifications
   - Tap "Mark All As Read"
   - Check teacher notification badge (should be 0)
   - Navigate to student notifications
   - Check student notification badge
3. **Expected**:
   - Teacher notifications marked as read
   - Student notifications remain unread
   - No errors

### Test 5: Parent Notifications

1. **Setup**: Log in as a parent
2. **Test**:
   - Navigate to parent dashboard
   - Check notification badge count
   - Open notifications screen
   - Tap "Mark All As Read"
3. **Expected**:
   - Parent sees their notifications
   - Mark all as read works without errors
   - Badge count updates correctly

### Test 6: Single Notification Mark As Read

1. **Setup**: Log in as any user type with unread notifications
2. **Test**:
   - Open notifications screen
   - Tap on a single notification to mark it as read
   - Check badge count decreases by 1
3. **Expected**:
   - Single notification marked as read
   - Badge count updates correctly
   - No other user's notifications affected

### Test 7: Cross-User Type Switching

1. **Setup**: Log in as teacher, student, and parent
2. **Test**:
   - Switch between dashboards (teacher â†’ student â†’ parent)
   - Check notification badge on each dashboard
   - Open notifications on each dashboard
3. **Expected**:
   - Each dashboard shows correct user type's notifications
   - Badge counts are accurate for each user type
   - No cross-contamination

## Console Logging

The services now include detailed console logging for debugging:

- `ðŸ”‘ TEACHER NOTIFICATION SERVICE:` - Teacher service operations
- `ðŸ”‘ PARENT NOTIFICATION SERVICE:` - Parent service operations
- `ðŸ”‘ STUDENT NOTIFICATION SERVICE:` - Student service operations
- `ðŸ”” NOTIFICATION CONTEXT:` - Context-level operations

Look for these logs to verify correct service is being used.

## Backward Compatibility

The original `notificationService.js` is kept for backward compatibility but should no longer be used for user-specific operations. It's only used as a fallback in the NotificationContext.

## Migration Notes

If you have custom code that directly imports from `notificationService.js`, update it to use the user-type-specific services:

**Before:**
```javascript
import { getNotifications } from '../services/notificationService';
```

**After:**
```javascript
// For teachers
import { getTeacherNotifications } from '../services/teacherNotificationService';

// For parents
import { getParentNotifications } from '../services/parentNotificationService';

// For students
import { getStudentNotifications } from '../services/studentNotificationService';
```

## Benefits

1. **Complete Isolation**: Each user type has its own service with no cross-contamination
2. **Type Safety**: Clear separation makes it obvious which service to use
3. **Easier Debugging**: Console logs clearly show which service is being used
4. **Better Maintainability**: Changes to one user type don't affect others
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new user types or modify existing ones

## Future Improvements

1. Add TypeScript for better type safety
2. Add unit tests for each service
3. Add integration tests for cross-user scenarios
4. Consider adding service-level caching per user type
5. Add metrics/analytics per user type
