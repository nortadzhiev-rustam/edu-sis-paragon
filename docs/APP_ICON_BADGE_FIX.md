# App Icon Badge Fix

This document explains the fix for the app icon badge not disappearing when there are no unread notifications.

## Problem

The app icon badge (red number on the app icon) was not updating properly when notifications were marked as read or when there were no unread notifications. The badge would remain visible even after all notifications were read.

## Root Cause

The app was not explicitly managing the app icon badge count using `Notifications.setBadgeCountAsync()`. While the notification handler was configured with `shouldSetBadge: true`, this only sets the badge when notifications are received, but doesn't clear it when notifications are read.

## Solution

### 1. Added App Icon Badge Management to NotificationContext

**File: `src/contexts/NotificationContext.js`**

#### Added Badge Update Function:
```javascript
const updateAppIconBadge = async (count) => {
  try {
    await Notifications.setBadgeCountAsync(count);
    console.log(`üì± BADGE: App icon badge updated to ${count}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('‚ùå BADGE: Error updating app icon badge:', error);
  }
};
```

#### Added Total Unread Count Calculation:
```javascript
const getTotalUnreadCount = () => {
  // Get total unread count from all student notifications
  const studentUnreadTotal = Object.values(studentUnreadCounts).reduce(
    (total, count) => total + count,
    0
  );
  
  // Return the higher of main unread count or student unread total
  return Math.max(unreadCount, studentUnreadTotal);
};
```

#### Added Automatic Badge Updates:
```javascript
// Update app icon badge whenever unread count or student unread counts change
useEffect(() => {
  const totalUnread = getTotalUnreadCount();
  updateAppIconBadge(totalUnread);
}, [unreadCount, studentUnreadCounts]);
```

### 2. Enhanced Messaging Utility Badge Management

**File: `src/utils/messaging.js`**

#### Updated `storeNotificationInHistory`:
- Added badge count update when new notifications are stored
- Calculates unread count and updates badge accordingly

#### Updated `markNotificationAsRead`:
- Added badge count update when notifications are marked as read
- Recalculates unread count and updates badge

#### Updated `clearNotificationHistory`:
- Added badge clearing when all notifications are cleared
- Sets badge count to 0

### 3. Added Badge Testing Function

**File: `src/utils/demoNotifications.js`**

```javascript
export const testAppIconBadge = async () => {
  // Test setting badge to different numbers
  for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    await Notifications.setBadgeCountAsync(i);
    console.log(`üì± BADGE TEST: Set app icon badge to ${i}`);
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
  }
  
  // Clear badge
  await Notifications.setBadgeCountAsync(0);
  console.log('üì± BADGE TEST: Cleared app icon badge');
};
```

## How It Works

### Badge Update Triggers

1. **When notifications are loaded**: Badge is set to total unread count
2. **When notifications are marked as read**: Badge count is decremented
3. **When notifications are cleared**: Badge is set to 0
4. **When new notifications are received**: Badge count is incremented

### Multi-User Support

For parent accounts with multiple students:
- Badge shows the total unread count across all students
- Uses `getTotalUnreadCount()` to calculate combined unread count
- Automatically updates when any student's unread count changes

### Platform Compatibility

- Works on both iOS and Android
- Uses Expo Notifications `setBadgeCountAsync()` for cross-platform compatibility
- Includes error handling for platforms that don't support badges

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Test badge increment**:
   ```javascript
   import { testAppIconBadge } from '../utils/demoNotifications';
   await testAppIconBadge();
   ```

2. **Test with real notifications**:
   - Send notifications to the app
   - Check that badge appears with correct count
   - Mark notifications as read
   - Verify badge decrements or disappears

3. **Test badge clearing**:
   - Mark all notifications as read
   - Verify badge disappears completely

### Expected Behavior

- ‚úÖ Badge appears when unread notifications exist
- ‚úÖ Badge shows correct unread count
- ‚úÖ Badge decrements when notifications are marked as read
- ‚úÖ Badge disappears when no unread notifications remain
- ‚úÖ Badge updates for parent accounts with multiple students
- ‚úÖ Badge persists across app restarts until notifications are read

## Console Logging

The implementation includes comprehensive logging:
- `üì± BADGE: App icon badge updated to X` - Badge update success
- `‚ùå BADGE: Error updating app icon badge` - Badge update errors
- `üì± BADGE: Updated app icon badge to X after [action]` - Context-specific updates

## Integration Points

### NotificationContext Integration
- Badge management is integrated into the main notification context
- Automatically handles all notification state changes
- Supports both API and local notification management

### Messaging Utility Integration
- Badge updates are included in all notification storage operations
- Maintains consistency between local storage and badge count
- Handles both foreground and background notification scenarios

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. **Badge customization** - Different badge styles for different notification types
2. **Badge grouping** - Separate badges for different user roles
3. **Badge persistence** - Store badge count in AsyncStorage for offline scenarios
4. **Badge analytics** - Track badge interaction patterns
