### 3. Realistic Data Structure
All demo data follows the same structure as real API responses, ensuring:
- Consistent user experience
- Proper testing of UI components
- Accurate representation of app functionality
- Seamless transition between demo and production modes

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
1. User enters demo credentials on login screen
2. `authService.js` detects demo credentials and returns demo user data
3. Demo user data includes `demo_mode: true` flag
4. App components check for demo mode and display appropriate indicators

### Demo Mode Detection
```javascript
import { isDemoMode } from '../services/authService';

// Check if user is in demo mode
const isDemo = isDemoMode(userData);

// Or check current user from AsyncStorage
import { isCurrentUserInDemoMode } from '../services/demoModeService';
const isDemo = await isCurrentUserInDemoMode();
```

### Demo Data Services
- `demoModeService.js` - Central service for all demo data
- `getDemoTimetableData()` - Timetable data for teachers and students
- `getDemoBPSData()` - Behavior point system data
- `getDemoAttendanceData()` - Attendance records and statistics
- `getDemoGradesData()` - Academic grades and assessments
- `getDemoHomeworkData()` - Homework assignments and submissions
- `getDemoNotificationData()` - System notifications

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. Open the EduSIS app
2. Navigate to the login screen
3. Expand the "Demo Credentials" card
4. Select the desired user type (Teacher, Student, or Parent)
5. Tap "Use These Credentials" or manually enter the demo username and password
6. Log in to explore the app with sample data

### For Developers
1. Demo mode is automatically detected based on login credentials
2. No additional configuration required
3. Demo data is served instead of API calls when demo mode is active
4. All existing features work normally with demo data

```

### Data Flow
1. **Login:** Demo credentials → Demo user data with `demo_mode: true`
2. **Storage:** Demo user data stored in AsyncStorage
3. **Detection:** Components check `userData.demo_mode` flag
4. **Display:** Demo mode indicators shown when active
5. **Data:** Demo data services provide sample data for all features

## Security Considerations

- Demo credentials are hardcoded and publicly visible
- Demo mode only provides sample data, no real user information
- Demo users cannot access or modify production data
- Demo mode is clearly indicated to prevent confusion
- No sensitive operations are performed in demo mode

## Future Enhancements

- **Multiple Demo Scenarios:** Different demo datasets for various use cases
- **Interactive Tutorials:** Guided tours within demo mode
- **Feature Highlighting:** Emphasize specific features during demos
- **Custom Demo Data:** Allow customization of demo datasets
- **Demo Mode Analytics:** Track demo usage for improvement insights
